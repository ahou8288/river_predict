# River Prediction website
Predict rivers based on previous history and current rainfall predictions

# Intro
This is a web dev project to display the river levels of rivers in Australia.

The intention is to also include a ML component to predict river levels up to a week in advance.

I stopped working on this because I decided that I didn't like the tech stack I was working in, and wanted to learn something new.
